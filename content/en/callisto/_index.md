Callisto is a desktop game engine written in [Odin](https://odin-lang.org) with a Vulkan renderer. It is still early in development and the API is subject to change. 
When there is a stable release I will add documentation here.

In the meantime, see the [Callisto GitHub repository](https://github.com/bazzagibbs/callisto) for a brief overview of how the engine is used, or 
[Callisto-Sandbox](https://github.com/bazzas-personal-stuff/callisto-sandbox) for a sample implementation.
